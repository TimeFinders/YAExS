\section{VISION STATEMENT}
\subsection{Executive Summary} %Vera
\textcolor{blue}{The vision statement should include an elevator summary of the project (6 points)}

% still rough draft. I prefer to write roughly and make it better so excuse me if its awkward.
For years, final exam scheduling at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has been completed by hand in the Registrar’s Office. 
Unfortunately, this often leads to large numbers of students having three or more exams in one day and, in some cases, students with multiple exams scheduled at the same time.  
 The process is also time-consuming since it requires integration of many different types of data (course schedules, student registrar, room availability, cross-listed courses, etc). 


We will design an automated system to schedule exams which we call YAExS (Yet Another Exam Scheduler - pronounced “yikes!”). 
This system will integrate all the data necessary to schedule exams and schedule them intelligently to reduce conflicts. 
The entire system will be customizable, easy to use, and flexible so that changes to the exam schedule can be made at any time.

\section{USER SCENARIOS}  %JEFF+VERA
\textcolor{blue}{The User Scenario should create a realistic picture of a persona using the software.  
Look for details about the Persona and the User Interface.  
Did the Persona achieve their goal?  
Was the User Scenario compelling?  
Is the picture painted realistic and detailed?
Each has a persona, goals, and sequence of steps}

\item[Name:] Reggie Star
\item[Age:]  65
\item[Occupation:] RPI Assistant Registrar
\item[Background:] Reggie came to RPI in 1984 when he  back moved from Chicago to raise his children in the capital area where he was raised. 
He worked in various offices of the administration before becoming the Assistant Registrar in 1997. 
He has used web-based applications in the past, but it takes him some time to get accustomed to new interfaces. 
He uses Microsoft Excel often but has never written his own code and has never used Excel’s optimization capabilities.

\item[Goals:]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Keep his email inbox clear of scheduling requests.
\item Prevent erroneous requests from affecting the final exam schedule (ex students making fake requests, professors personal vacations, etc.)
\item Reduce time spent supervising work study students handcrafting lists of cross-listed courses at the beginning of each semester.
\item Reduce or eliminate need to schedule exams by hand.
\item Minimize or eliminate need to schedule make-up exams for students with two exams scheduled at the same time or with multiple exams in one day.
\item Update final exam schedule to accommodate last minute requests from professors.
\end{enumerate}

\item[Sequence of Steps]
During the second week of classes Reggie logs on to his YAExS account and sees that all instructors have already logged in and input their exam preferences.  
Reggie clicks the “instructor preference summary” button to see an overview of the data from instructors. He sees that 195 courses need to have exams scheduled, with 42 of those made up of multiple sections. Five professors have indicated that they do not want exams on the last day, and twelve would prefer not to have evening exams.

He can now input his configuration settings and schedule exams.
