\section{Vision Statement}
\subsection{Executive Summary} %Vera
\textcolor{blue}{The vision statement should include an elevator summary of the project (6 points)}

% still rough draft. I prefer to write roughly and make it better so excuse me if its awkward.
For years, final exam scheduling at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has been
 completed by hand in the Registrar’s Office. 
Unfortunately, this often leads to large numbers of students having three or more
 exams in one day and, in some cases, students with multiple exams scheduled at
 the same time.  
 The process is also time-consuming since it requires integration of many different
 types of data (course schedules, student registration, room availability, etc). 

We will create an automated web-based system to schedule exams which we call YAExS 
(Yet Another Exam Scheduler - pronounced “yikes!”).
Using the Unified Process of software engineering, we will develop YAExS
 over the coming semester. 
This report represents the first stage of our project: Inception. 
Yet to come are the Project Elaboration, two Project Stakeholder Product Reviews,
 and a Transition Report.

\begin{comment}
This system will integrate all the data necessary to schedule exams and create a
excellent exam schedule.  
The entire system will be customizable, easy to use, and flexible
 so that the exam schedule can be changed to satisfy last-minute requirements.
\end{comment}







\subsection{Business Case} %Andrew
\textcolor{blue}{ business case for the project (including a short analysis of the
 competition, market space or similar commercial off the shelf software) (12 points),}
, reduce/eliminate conflicts which cause headaches for students\&professors\&the registrar, minimize hand-word needed and so reduce errors,will speed up exam scheduling by allow preferences to be stated before the exam schedule is made so the schedule does not have to be remade several times, will allow for easy sensitivity analysis (e.g. what if we want to have just 16 exam periods, or what if we don't use west hall, or what if we want to minimize the number of students with back-to-back finals).
\subsection{Project Stakeholders} %Andrew
\textcolor{blue}{a description of the project stakeholders (7 points),}
\subsection{Major Features} %Auston
\textcolor{blue}{ list of the major features of the completed project (7 points),}
% General list for now. Formatting/Table-ing could be improved later
\begin{itemize}
\item Interface for course instructors
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Specify which courses have exams
  \item Request particular times, dates, rooms, or other preferences
  \item Receive updates on scheduling from the registrar
  \end{itemize}
\item Interface for the registrar
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Ability to start the schedule optimization
  \item Communicate with course instructors and department schedulers
  \item Track which instructors have not yet responded
  \item Post the completed schedule to a public website
  \item Upload data on which courses each student is taking % Good for now? We still don't know the details here...
  \item Manual control over schedules after generation
  \end{itemize}
\item Interface for students
  \begin{itemize}
  \item View entire up-to-date exam schedule on website
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Major Risks} %Auston
\textcolor{blue}{a and a list of the major risks of the project (10 points)}
\textcolor{red}{Vera's thoughts. I'm not really sure what risks are. but here are some possibilities that popped into my head while procrastinating on writing my own sections:
scheduling algorithm may not converge,
may not be able to get all data in a usable form,
registrar may decide not to let us use student data for privacy reasons 
registrar may hate the project}
\begin{itemize}
\item The scheduling algorithm may not converge, leaving the core of the system useless.
\item Limited experience with web development and database management.
\item For privacy reasons, the registrar may not be willing to provide detailed information about which courses students are taking. Without that, the scheduler would not be able to accurately prevent conflicts.
\item Some of our preferred programming languages may have difficulty communicating between each other. % Not sure about this one.
\end{itemize}

\section{User Scenarios}  %JEFF+VERA
\textcolor{blue}{The User Scenario should create a realistic picture of a persona using the software.  
Look for details about the Persona and the User Interface.  
Did the Persona achieve their goal?  
Was the User Scenario compelling?  
Is the picture painted realistic and detailed?
Each has a persona, goals, and sequence of steps}

\begin{description}
\item[Name:] Reggie Star
\item[Age:]  65
\item[Occupation:] RPI Assistant Registrar
\item[Background:] Reggie came to RPI in 1984 when he  back moved from
 Chicago to raise his children in the capital area where he was raised. 
He worked in various offices of the administration before becoming
 the Assistant Registrar in 1997. 
He has used web-based applications in the past, but it takes him some 
time to get accustomed to new interfaces. 
He uses Microsoft Excel often but has never written his own code
 and has never used Excel’s optimization capabilities.

\item[Goals:]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Keep his email inbox clear of scheduling requests.
\item Prevent erroneous requests from affecting the final exam schedule
 (ex students making fake requests, professors personal vacations, etc.)
\item Reduce time spent supervising work study students handcrafting lists of
 cross-listed courses at the beginning of each semester.
\item Reduce or eliminate need to schedule exams by hand.
\item Minimize or eliminate need to schedule make-up exams for students with
 two exams scheduled at the same time or with multiple exams in one day.
\item Update final exam schedule to accommodate last minute requests 
from professors.
\end{enumerate}

\item[Sequence of Steps]
During the second week of classes Reggie logs on to his YAExS account and
 sees that all instructors have already logged in and input their exam preferences.  
Reggie clicks the “instructor preference summary” button to see an overview of
 the data from instructors. He sees that 195 courses need to have exams
 scheduled, with 42 of those made up of multiple sections. 
Five professors have indicated that they do not want exams on the last day, 
and twelve would prefer not to have evening exams.

He can now input his configuration settings and schedule exam.
He marks his preference as "reduce evening exams" since he has had many professors
in the past complain when their exams were scheduled in the evening, 
even if they didn't express that preference ahead of time. Next he clicks "schedule exams."

The next day, Reggie returns to check on his exam schedule. When he logs in, he sees
that an exam schedule has been computed. He clicks "exam schedule summary" and sees that
the the exam schedule has no exam conflicts, uses only 15 evening slots, and respects all
the professor preferences. 

Satisfied with this schedule, Reggie clicks: download exam schedule file and sends it to all
department heads for a final review.
