\textcolor{blue}{The vision statement should include an elevator summary of the project (6 points)}

For years, final exam scheduling at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has been completed by hand in the Registrarâ€™s Office. Unfortunately, this often leads to large numbers of students having three or more exams in one day and, in some cases, students with multiple exams scheduled at the same time.  According to Michael Conroy, Assistant Registrar at RPI, these problems cause high levels of stress in students and require negotiations betweens between professors and students to reschedule exams.
